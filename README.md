# SHAPE DETECTOR 


## Basic Details
### Team Name:[HACK ACADEMIA 3.0]


### Team Members
- Team Lead: [VISHNU HAREENDRAN] - [COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING THALASSERY]
- Member 2: [ASWANA ASHOK] - [COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING THALASSERY]
  

### Project Description
[2-3 lines about what your project does]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[What ridiculous problem are you solving?]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[How are you solving it? Keep it fun!]

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- [Python (for backend logic in app.py)
HTML (for web page templates in templates/)
JavaScript (for client-side scripting in static/script.js)
CSS (likely used within your HTML files for styling)
Flask (Python web framework)]
- Frameworks used: Flask (Python web framework)
- Libraries used: OpenCV (cv2), NumPy, base64, re, random, math, collections (Counter)
- Tools used: Python, Flask development server, web browser (for testing), image files (for shape detection)
  
### Implementation
For Software:The backend is implemented using Flask, a lightweight Python web framework. The main logic resides in `app.py`, which handles HTTP requests, renders HTML templates, and processes images for shape detection using OpenCV and NumPy. Users interact with the web interface via HTML pages (`index.html`, `landing.html`), and client-side interactivity is managed by JavaScript (`static/script.js`).

The shape detection works by drwing a shape, which is then analyzed on the server to identify geometric shapes. Results and fun, sarcastic comments are displayed to the user.

# Installation
. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repo-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd useless_project_temp
   ```
3. Install required Python packages:
   ```
   pip install flask opencv-python numpy
   ```


# Run
1. Start the Flask development server:

   python app.py
   
2. Open your web browser and go to:
   
   http://127.0.0.1:5000/
   
### Project Documentation
For Software:
 The project consists of a Flask backend (`app.py`) that handles image uploads and shape detection using OpenCV and NumPy.
- HTML templates (`index.html`, `landing.html`) provide the user interface, styled with CSS and enhanced with JavaScript (`static/script.js`).
- Users can draw shapes, and the backend processes these to detect shapes, returning results and fun comments.
- The README includes installation, run instructions, and technical details for easy setup and understanding.
